aprs-weather-submit (1.6-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Support for compiling with OpenWatcom (with -D_DOS). This will allow us to
  target 16-bit targets and retro machines, all the way back to MS-DOS and the
  8086 (without APRS-IS support, unless we figure out mTCP).  I've only tested
  it on FreeDos and an emulated 486 thus far.

  * Custom comments can be added to packets!  Use --comment to add your own
  notes to a packet.
  * When not using custom comments, the "X" in the comment field is removed.
  APRS packets rarely, if ever, use the operating system identifier these
  days, so there is no need to prefix the user agent with it.
  
  * Fix a bug (#9) where minute values less than ten would result in invalid
  uncompressed positions.  Thank you, ploeffler!
  * Fix a bug where the --altitude parameter was not being detected in its
  short form (-A).
  * Replace calls to strncat() with calls to strcat().  This eliminates on-
  by-default warnings in GCC 8.1.  Thank you, KR4DIO!
  
  * Removed dependency on <assert.h>.
