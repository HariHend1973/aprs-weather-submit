aprs-weather-submit (1.6-4) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Custom comments can be added to packets!  Use --comment` to add your own
  notes to a packet.
  * When not using custom comments, the "X" in the comment field is removed.
  APRS packets rarely, if ever, use the operating system identifier these days,
  so there is no need to prefix the user agent or comment with it.
  * Fixed GitHub issue #9:  minute values less than ten would result in invalid
  uncompressed positions.  (Thank you, ploeffler!)
  * Fixed a bug where the --altitude parameter was not being detected in its
  short form (-A).
  * Fixed GitHub issue #6 (for real this time): Worked around a bug with APRS.fi
  where their site would reject packets with the temperature listed before the
  wind gust speeds.  This was not a bug in this app.  Thank you, PD9MWO!
  * Fixed GitHub issue #4 where GCC 8.1 would emit spurious warnings.  This was
  fixed by replacing calls to strncat() with strcat().  Thank you for the report
  and the pull request, KR4DIO!
  * Removed dependency on <assert.h>.
