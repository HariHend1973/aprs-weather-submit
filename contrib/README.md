# Unsupported patches for `aprs-weather-submit`

These are experiments, testing things, and other stuff that I've been working on.  None of these patches are supported, and should be assumed to break with every single release and/or Git commit since they were written.  Anything in this folder should be used **at your own risk!**  (However, patches and pull requests are welcome.)

*  convert-to-C89.patch:  allows a C89 compiler to build this app, though without APRS-IS support.
