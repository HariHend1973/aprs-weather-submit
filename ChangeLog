Version 1.5 (September 26, 2020):
- Replace the Makefile with an Autoconf script.
- Replace the -DNO_APRSIS make option with the --without-aprs-is configure
  switch.
- Add support for disabling assertions with the --disable-assert configure
  switch (though I recommend not using this).
- Conform with GNU coding standards by adding plain-text versions of GitHub's
  CHANGELOG.md (as ChangeLog), LICENSE (COPYING), and README.md (as README).
  Also, added a NEWS document.
- Add the --no-comment option to suppress this app's user agent in the comment
  section of the packet.
- Add the --altitude option to allow for reporting the location's altitude, in
  feet above mean sea level.

Version 1.4 (March 8, 2020):
- Fixed a bug where latitudes and longitudes were not being converted into DMS
  exactly as they should be, which had been leading to minor position inaccuracies.
- Made uncompressed positions the default again, because APRS.fi doesn't support
  weather packets with compressed positions.  This is a long-standing bug on
  their web site.  For more information, see: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/aprsfi/compressed%7Csort:date/aprsfi/uzjdm026NZQ/FqES7V2iAwAJ
- The -0 and --uncompressed-positions options are still accepted for backwards
  compatibility, but no longer do anything.
- Better documentation for the compression type byte.
- Changed the copyright date for the new year.

Version 1.3.1 (September 14, 2019):
- Fixed a bug where uncompressed latitudes greater than 90Â° were truncated.
  This was not the default behavior.  My apologies to anyone in Asia, Australia,
  Oceania, and most of the Americas.

Version 1.3 (July 31, 2019):
- Added the compile-time option NO_APRSIS to strip all Internet-related
  functionality, just in case you're *really* low on space.

Version 1.2.1 (July 31, 2019)
- Added <stdint.h> to prevent compiler errors.  (Thank you to UR3QJW for
  reporting this.)
- Switched from ANSI C to the C99 standard, in order to keep using snprintf().
  Some compilers are stricter than mine and refuse to compile K&R C with it.
  (Another thank you to UR3QJW.)
- Since we switched to C99, I added some tiny performance enhancements with the
  restrict and inline keywords.
- Fixed a pair of bugs where uncompressed packets would fail to encode the
  location correctly.
- Fixed a bug where wind speeds would not be reported properly in compressed
  packets, because math is hard.
- Added linker options to the Makefile to fix linking errors with GCC 7.
- Code cleanup.
- Known issue when compiling with GCC 7 and newer:  there will be many warnings
  about formatting.  These can be ignored.  Adding -Wno-format-detection to the
  Makefile will quiet it down.  This will be patched in a future release.

Version 1.2 (April 16, 2019):
- Added preliminary support for compiling on Windows.
- Added the option of using APRS uncompressed positions at runtime with the 
  --uncompressed-position switch, rather than a compile-time choice.
- Removed a dependency on <stdint.h>.  (This would be restored in v1.2.1.)
- Fixed a bug where impractically large APRS-IS packets would be truncated. This
  was unlikely to affect real-world use.

Version 1.1 (January 23, 2019), codename "QLF"
- Added support for reporting temperatures in degrees Celsius.
- Added a Makefile for POSIX systems.
- Added a man page.
- Fixed a bug where negative temperatures may cause the packet to fail to encode.
- Cleaned up some documentation.

Version 1.0 (January 21, 2019), codename "QRV"
- Added significant documentation.

Version 0.3 (January 20, 2019), codename "QST"
- Wrote help.
- Added support for actually sending the packet to an APRS-IS IGate.
- Changed the position and wind data to compressed from uncompressed.  For now,
  this can only be undone at compile-time.

Version 0.2 (January 18, 2019), codename "Strings are hard"
- Added support for snowfall, as clarified in APRS 1.1's errata.
- Added support for the APRS 1.2 parameters: radiation, water level, and voltage.

Version 0.1 (January 14, 2019), codename Q
- Initial private release.
