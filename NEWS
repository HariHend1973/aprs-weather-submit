# aprs-weather-submit news

This file details all of the user-facing changes that are in version 1.5 of
aprs-weather-submit. For more details, please consult the CHANGELOG file or
this project's GitHub page.

## NEW AND IMPROVED INSTALLATION PROCESS

The Makefile was replaced by an Autoconf script.  Users will be able to
install this package with the usual *nix process:

./configure
make
make install

Because of this, the -DNO_APRSIS make option is being removed.  Instead, run
./configure --without-aprs-is.


## ALTITUDE REPORTING

This app now supports reporting your altitude.  Use the --altitude (-A) option
and include how far above sea level you are.

Per the APRS 1.01 specification, this is included in the comment field, so not
all APRS parsers may recognize it.


## DISABLE COMMENTS

Do you want to shrink your APRS packets?  Use the --no-comment runtime option,
and aprs-weather-submit will no longer include a comment.  This will remove its
name and version in the comment section of your packet, and it will strip the
"APRS Software Type" character (which has been hardcoded to X for Linux).  Note
that this will not affect the aforementioned altitude reporting.

However, if you do use this option, please consider telling a friend about
aprs-weather-submit.
