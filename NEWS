# aprs-weather-submit news

This file details all of the user-facing changes that are in versions 1.5.x of
aprs-weather-submit. For more details, please consult the CHANGELOG file or
this project's GitHub page.

## NEW AND IMPROVED INSTALLATION PROCESS

The Makefile was replaced by an Autoconf script and a proper *nix build process.
Users will be able to install this package with the usual *nix process:

./autogen.sh
./configure
make
make install

Because of this, the -DNO_APRSIS make option is being removed.  Instead, run
./configure --disable-aprs-is


## ALTITUDE REPORTING

This app now supports reporting your altitude.  Use the --altitude (-A) option
and include how far above sea level you are.

Per the APRS 1.01 specification, this is included in the comment field, so not
all APRS parsers may recognize it.


## DISABLE COMMENTS

Do you want to shrink your APRS packets?  Use the --no-comment runtime option,
and aprs-weather-submit will no longer include a comment.  This will remove its
name and version in the comment section of your packet, and it will strip the
"APRS Software Type" character (which has been hardcoded to X for Linux).  Note
that this will not affect the aforementioned altitude reporting.

However, if you do use this option, please consider telling a friend about
aprs-weather-submit.

## SUPPORT FOR NON-INTEL/AMD ARCHITECTURES

Minor changes to the code have allowed this to compile and run on non-AMD64 and
non-Intel systems.  So far, 64-bit PowerPC (big- and little-endian) has been
tested and verified to work.  Please file a bug report to let us know if this
code runs on other architectures!
